Optimization Methods in Data Science

Course Description: Linear and non-linear programming, convex sets and functions, convex and non-convex optimization problems, duality, Newton's methods, barrier methods, linear equality, and inequality constraints. Emphasis on computation methods and programming.

This contains some of my Python classwork and my final project, which was completed with two other classmates. We were tasked with creating a Support Vector Machine for binary and multiclass classification, then we were to compare our results with scikit-learn.
